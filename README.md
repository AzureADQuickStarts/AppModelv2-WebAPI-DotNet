# This sample has been archived

A newer version of this sample is available from [AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-NativeClient-DotNet](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-NativeClient-DotNet). This shows how a WPF desktop application calls a Web API part of the same Azure AD application.

If you really wish to view the archived sample (which was for MSAL 1.0.0), please switch to the [complete](https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/AppModelv2-WebAPI-DotNet/tree/complete) branch. This code is no longer maintained and functionality is not guaranteed.
